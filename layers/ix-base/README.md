# Nuxt Layer ix-base

Create Nuxt extendable layer with this GitHub template.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Working on your theme

Your theme is at the root of this repository, it is exactly like a regular Nuxt project, except you can publish it on NPM.

The `.nuxt` directory should help you on trying your theme during development.

Running `yarn dev` will prepare and boot `.nuxt` directory, which imports your theme itself.
